Since GitHub will re-upload the cards and serve them from their [CDN](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls), we can not infer the browser/GitHub theme on the server side. There are, however, four methods you can use to create dynamics themes on the client side.
